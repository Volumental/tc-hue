tc-hue
======

Updates a Philips Hue depending on TeamCity build status.

Create a `config.json` file based on the `config_example.json` in the repository. You'll
need to enter TeamCity hostname and credentials as well as the ip/hostname of the Philips Hue
Bridge.

Then simply run `python update_lamp.py` to update the lamps.

On the current build server the update script is run as a cron task under builder user from the path:
/home/builder/tc-hue/

Dependencies

* phue
* tweepy
* pygame (available here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml )
* mock (only if you want to run tests)
